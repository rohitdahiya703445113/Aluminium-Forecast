## 1. Project Overview

This service predicts the price of aluminium parts for the **next 12 calendar months**, starting from the current month. Prices are forecast **quarter by quarter** — the same quarterly market data (LME, Midwest, PPI, CNG) applies to all three months within a quarter, and each month's predicted price is used as the base for the next month (chained forecasting).

**Key concepts:**
- **Part Number + Tier 1** together form the unique identifier for a part. The same part number can appear under multiple Tier 1 suppliers (e.g. "Kadon Aerospace", "Point Precision Inc.", "NA") with different weights and prices.
- **PWt (Part Weight in lbs)** is a fixed property of each part + supplier combination.
- **Current price** is always read from `aluminium_data.xlsx` — it cannot be overridden via the API.
- All market data (LME, Midwest premium, PPI, CNG) is stored in `aluminium_data.xlsx` and loaded once into memory at startup (cached).

---

## 2. Forecasting Formula

The core formula predicts the price at the **last month of each quarter**, then chains forward:

```
P_next = P_current
         + [ (AMS_Q − AMS_Q-1) × PWt ]
         + [ PPI_Factor × P_current ]
```

Where:

| Variable | Definition |
|---|---|
| `AMS_Q` | `(MC_Q × DF_c) + CNG_Q` — Alloy Metal + Gas cost, current quarter |
| `AMS_Q-1` | `(MC_Q-1 × DF_c) + CNG_Q-1` — same for previous quarter |
| `MC_Q` | `avg(LME, quarter months) + avg(Midwest, quarter months)` in $/lb |
| `MC_Q-1` | Same as MC_Q but for the previous quarter |
| `PPI_Q` | PPI index value at the **last month** of the current quarter |
| `PPI_Q-1` | PPI index value at the **last month** of the previous quarter |
| `PPI_Factor` | `(PPI_Q − PPI_Q-1) / PPI_Q-1` |
| `CNG_Q` | CNG cost at the **last month** of the current quarter ($/lb) |
| `CNG_Q-1` | CNG cost at the **last month** of the previous quarter ($/lb) |
| `DF_c` | Fixed constant = **1.44** |
| `PWt` | Part weight in lbs (fixed per Part Number + Tier 1) |

**Iteration logic:** Starting from the current month (auto-detected from system clock), the engine forecasts the first month of the next quarter, then the second, and so on for 12 months. Each predicted price becomes the `P_current` for the next month.

**Example (sitting in Aug 2026):**
- Step 1 → Forecast Sep 2026 using Q3-2026 data, base = Aug 2026 actual price
- Step 2 → Forecast Oct 2026 using Q4-2026 data, base = Sep 2026 predicted price
- Step 3 → Forecast Nov 2026 using Q4-2026 data, base = Oct 2026 predicted price
- ... and so on through Aug 2027

## 4. File-by-File Guide

### `main.py`
The application entry point. Creates the FastAPI app, registers CORS middleware, attaches all routers, and defines the `/health` endpoint. **Start reading here** when first exploring the codebase.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

---

### `app/core/config.py`
Central place for all tunable constants. Uses `pydantic-settings` so any value can be overridden via an environment variable without changing code.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DF_C` | `1.44` | Density/conversion factor in the AMS formula |
| `FORECAST_HORIZON_MONTHS` | `12` | Number of months to forecast |

If you ever need to change `DF_c`, change it here — not inside the formula code.

---

### `app/core/logging_config.py`
Sets up a single structured log format used across the whole app:
```
2026-08-25 10:30:00 | INFO     | app.services.forecast_engine:285 | Starting forecast...
```
Called once at startup inside `main.py`. Every other module just does:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

---

### `app/data/base.py` ⭐ Read this first
Defines the **abstract interfaces (contracts)** that all business logic depends on. There are two abstract classes:

- **`MarketDataRepository`** — must implement `get_lme()`, `get_midwest_premium()`, `get_ppi()`, `get_cng()`. Each takes a `YYYY-MM` string and returns `float | None`.
- **`PartRepository`** — must implement `get_part_weight(part_number, tier_1)` and `get_base_price(part_number, tier_1, year_month)`.

**The forecast engine only ever imports these abstractions — never any concrete implementation.** This is the key architectural decision that makes the data source swappable. See [How to Swap a Data Source](#8-how-to-swap-a-data-source).

---

### `app/data/excel_store.py` ⭐ Active data source
Reads `aluminium_data.xlsx` and implements both abstract interfaces.

- **`ExcelMarketDataRepository`** — serves LME, Midwest, PPI, CNG values from their respective sheets.
- **`ExcelPartRepository`** — looks up parts using **(Part Number + Tier 1)** as the composite key.
- **`get_all_parts()`** — returns every row from the Parts sheet; used by the `/parts` listing endpoint.
- **Caching** — the workbook is loaded once via `@lru_cache`. To reload after editing the Excel without restarting the server, call `POST /api/v1/forecast-excel/reload`.
- **Important detail:** `keep_default_na=False` is passed to pandas so the string `"NA"` (a valid Tier 1 value) is not silently converted to `NaN`.

---

### `app/data/hardcoded_store.py`
The original hardcoded data store kept for reference. Not connected to any active endpoint. Useful as a pattern reference if you need to write a new data source adapter or run tests without file I/O.

---

### `app/services/forecast_engine.py` ⭐ Core business logic
Contains `ForecastEngine` — a stateless class injected with a `MarketDataRepository` and a `PartRepository` at construction time.

**Main public method:** `forecast(part_number: str, tier_1: str) -> ForecastResponse`

What it does, step by step:
1. Detects the current month from the system clock (`YYYY-MM`)
2. Looks up `PWt` (weight in lbs) for the part + tier_1 combination
3. Looks up the current base price from the data store
4. For each of the next 12 months:
   - Determines the calendar quarter
   - Builds a `QuarterContext` (MC_Q, AMS_Q, PPI_Q, CNG_Q, etc.) — **cached per quarter** so it is only computed once for all three months in the same quarter
   - Applies the formula to get `predicted_price`
   - Rolls `predicted_price` forward as `P_current` for the next step
5. Returns a `ForecastResponse` with all 12 `MonthForecast` objects, each containing every intermediate variable used in the formula

**Quarter helper functions** (at the top of the file):

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `_quarter_of_month(month)` | Returns 1–4 for a given month number |
| `_quarter_months(year, quarter)` | Returns the three `YYYY-MM` keys for a quarter |
| `_last_month_of_quarter(year, quarter)` | Returns the anchor month for PPI and CNG lookups |
| `_prev_quarter(year, quarter)` | Handles year rollover (Q1 → previous year Q4) |

---

### `app/services/batch_forecast.py`
Orchestrates multi-part forecasting and builds the output Excel workbook.

Two main functions:

- **`read_parts_from_upload(file_bytes)`** — reads the uploaded input Excel, finds `Part Number` and `Tier 1` columns (case-insensitive match), deduplicates while preserving order, and returns a list of `(part_number, tier_1)` tuples.

- **`build_forecast_workbook(part_tier_pairs, engine)`** — runs the engine for every pair, then builds a 13-sheet workbook (1 Summary + 12 monthly sheets). Parts that fail (unknown part, missing price, etc.) produce a red **ERROR row** instead of stopping the entire batch.

**Output column order in each monthly sheet:**

`Part Number → Tier 1 → Weight → Base Price Used → Quarter (Current) → Quarter (Previous) → MC_Q → MC_Q-1 → PPI_Q → PPI_Q-1 → PPI Factor → CNG_Q → CNG_Q-1 → AMS_Q → AMS_Q-1 → AMS Delta → DF_c → Predicted Price`

---

### `app/models/request.py`
Pydantic model for the single-part endpoint body. Validates incoming JSON before it reaches the engine.

```json
{
  "part_number": "09-0052-003",
  "tier_1": "Kadon Aerospace"
}
```

---

### `app/models/response.py`
Three nested Pydantic models that define the API response shape:

- **`QuarterContext`** — all 10 intermediate quarterly variables (MC_Q, AMS_Q, PPI_Factor, CNG_Q, AMS_delta, and their previous-quarter counterparts)
- **`MonthForecast`** — one month's result: `predicted_price`, `base_price_used`, `pwt`, `df_c`, and a nested `QuarterContext`
- **`ForecastResponse`** — top-level: `part_number`, `tier_1`, `base_price`, `pwt_lbs`, and a list of 12 `MonthForecast` objects

---

### `app/api/v1/router.py`
Registers the two active endpoint routers under the `/api/v1` prefix:

```python
api_v1_router.include_router(forecast_excel_router)   # /api/v1/forecast-excel
api_v1_router.include_router(forecast_batch_router)   # /api/v1/forecast-batch
```

To add a new endpoint group, create a file in `endpoints/`, define a FastAPI `APIRouter`, and add `include_router()` here.

---

### `app/api/v1/endpoints/forecast_excel.py`
Three routes under `/api/v1/forecast-excel`:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/parts` | List all Part Number + Tier 1 combinations from Excel with weight and price |
| `POST` | `/reload` | Clear the in-memory Excel cache so edits are picked up without restart |
| `POST` | `` (root) | Single-part forecast — returns JSON with full 12-month breakdown |

Uses **FastAPI dependency injection** (`Depends`) to wire repositories into the engine. To swap data sources, only the two factory functions at the top of this file (`get_market_repo` and `get_part_repo`) need to change.

---

### `app/api/v1/endpoints/forecast_batch.py`
Single route: `POST /api/v1/forecast-batch`

- Accepts `multipart/form-data` file upload (an `.xlsx` with `Part Number` + `Tier 1` columns)
- Returns a binary `.xlsx` download (13-sheet workbook)
- Sets `Content-Disposition: attachment` header so browsers and Axios trigger a file download automatically
- Includes `X-Parts-Count` response header for the frontend to know how many parts were processed

---

### `tests/test_forecast_engine.py`
Unit tests organised into four classes:

| Class | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `TestQuarterHelpers` | All quarter arithmetic utility functions |
| `TestForecastEngineHappyPath` | 12 months returned, correct chaining, manual formula verification, quarter caching |
| `TestForecastEngineErrors` | Unknown part, bad month format, missing market data |
| `TestHardcodedRepositories` | Data layer read behaviour |

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## 5. Data Layer

### `aluminium_data.xlsx` — 5 sheets

| Sheet | Columns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Parts** | Part Number, Tier 1, Weight (lbs), Current Price ($) | Unique key = Part Number + Tier 1 |
| **LME** | Month (YYYY-MM), LME Price ($/lb) | Green = actual, Yellow = projected |
| **Midwest** | Month (YYYY-MM), Midwest Premium ($/lb) | Same colour coding |
| **PPI** | Month (YYYY-MM), PPI Index (dimensionless) | BLS index value, not a dollar amount |
| **CNG** | Month (YYYY-MM), CNG Cost ($/lb) | Normalised to aluminium processing basis |

**After editing the Excel**, either restart the server or call `POST /api/v1/forecast-excel/reload` to pick up changes without restarting.

**Data coverage required:** The Excel must contain data from at least 2 quarters back through at least 3 quarters forward from today, so the engine can look up previous-quarter values and project 12 months ahead.

---

## 6. API Endpoints

Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`

| Method | Endpoint | Input | Output |

## 8. How to Swap a Data Source

The codebase is built so the **data source can change without touching any business logic**.

### To replace Excel with a live API (e.g. BLS for PPI, LME futures feed)

1. Create `app/data/api_store.py`
2. Write a class that inherits from `MarketDataRepository` (`app/data/base.py`) and implements all four methods
3. In `app/api/v1/endpoints/forecast_excel.py`, update the factory function:

```python
# Before
def get_market_repo() -> MarketDataRepository:
    return ExcelMarketDataRepository()

# After
def get_market_repo() -> MarketDataRepository:
    return LiveApiMarketDataRepository()   # your new class
```

Nothing else changes — the engine, models, and all other endpoints are unaffected.

### To replace the Parts sheet with an ERP system (SAP, Oracle, etc.)

Same pattern — implement `PartRepository` from `base.py` and swap the `get_part_repo()` factory function.

---

## 9. Excel File Format

### Parts sheet — edit this to add or update parts

| Part Number | Tier 1 | Weight (lbs) | Current Price ($) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 09-0052-003 | NA | 3.6 | 47.09 |
| 09-0052-003 | Kadon Aerospace | 3.6 | 49.50 |
| 2190-1015 | NA | 7.0 | 89.97 |

- **Part Number + Tier 1 = unique key.** The same part number can repeat under different suppliers.
- **Tier 1 = "NA"** means no specific supplier (default value).
- **Current Price** = the actual known price for the base month. Update this whenever the base month changes.

### Market data sheets (LME, Midwest, PPI, CNG)

| Month (YYYY-MM) | Value |
|---|---|
| 2026-07 | 1.4751 |
| 2026-08 | 1.4724 |
| 2026-09 | 1.4751 |

- **Green rows** = historical actuals
- **Yellow rows** = projected / forecasted values (will be replaced by live data in future)
- The engine needs rows from at least **2 quarters back** through **3 quarters forward** from today

---

## 10. Frontend Integration

### Single-part forecast (Axios)
```javascript
const response = await axios.post('/api/v1/forecast-excel', {
  part_number: '09-0052-003',
  tier_1: 'NA'
});

const { forecasts, base_price, pwt_lbs } = response.data;
// forecasts[0].month_label      → "September 2026"
// forecasts[0].predicted_price  → 57.9267
// forecasts[0].base_price_used  → 47.09  (actual for month 1, chained for rest)
```

### Batch forecast — upload input, download result (Axios)
```javascript
const form = new FormData();
form.append('file', excelFile);    // .xlsx with Part Number + Tier 1 columns

const response = await axios.post('/api/v1/forecast-batch', form, {
  responseType: 'blob'             // ← must be 'blob' to receive the binary file
});

// Trigger download in the browser
const url = URL.createObjectURL(response.data);
const a = document.createElement('a');
a.href = url;
a.download = 'forecast_result.xlsx';
a.click();
URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
```

### Input Excel format for the batch endpoint

The uploaded file must have these two column headers (matching is case-insensitive):

| Part Number | Tier 1 |
|---|---|
| 09-0052-003 | NA |
| 2190-1015 | NA |
| 09-0052-003 | Kadon Aerospace |

Duplicate rows (same Part Number + Tier 1 combination) are silently deduplicated.
